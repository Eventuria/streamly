-- This module is designed to be imported qualified:
--
-- @
-- import qualified Streamly.Prelude as S
-- @
--
-- Functions with the suffix @M@ are general functions that work on monadic
-- arguments. The corresponding functions without the suffix @M@ work on pure
-- arguments and can in general be derived from their monadic versions but are
-- provided for convenience and for consistency with other pure APIs in the
-- @base@ package.
--
-- In many cases, short definitions of the combinators are provided in the
-- documentation for illustration. The actual implementation may differ for
-- performance reasons.
--
-- Functions having a 'MonadAsync' constraint work concurrently when used with
-- appropriate stream type combinator. Please be careful to not use 'parallely'
-- with infinite streams.
--
-- Deconstruction and folds accept a 'SerialT' type instead of a polymorphic
-- type to ensure that streams always have a concrete monomorphic type by
-- default, reducing type errors. In case you want to use any other type of
-- stream you can use one of the type combinators provided in the "Streamly"
-- module to convert the stream type.

    -- ** Primitives
    -- | Primitives to construct a stream from pure values or monadic actions.
    -- All other stream construction and generation combinators described later
    -- can be expressed in terms of these primitives. However, the special
    -- versions provided in this module can be much more efficient in most
    -- cases. Users can create custom combinators using these primitives.

    --
    -- ** Enumeration
    -- | We can use the 'Enum' type class to enumerate a type producing a list
    -- and then convert it to a stream:
    --
    -- @
    -- 'fromList' $ 'Prelude.enumFromThen' from then
    -- @
    --
    -- However, this is not particularly efficient.
    -- The 'Enumerable' type class provides corresponding functions that
    -- generate a stream instead of a list, efficiently.

    , tail
    , init

    -- ** Folding
-- | In imperative terms a fold can be considered as a loop over the stream
-- that reduces the stream to a single value.
-- Left and right folds use a fold function @f@ and an identity element @z@
-- (@zero@) to recursively deconstruct a structure and then combine and reduce
-- the values or transform and reconstruct a new container.
--
-- In general, a right fold is suitable for transforming and reconstructing a
-- right associated structure (e.g. cons lists and streamly streams) and a left
-- fold is suitable for reducing a right associated structure.  The behavior of
-- right and left folds are described in detail in the individual fold's
-- documentation.  To illustrate the two folds for cons lists:
--
-- > foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
-- > foldr f z [] = z
-- > foldr f z (x:xs) = x `f` foldr f z xs
-- >
-- > foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
-- > foldl f z [] = z
-- > foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (z `f` x) xs
--
-- @foldr@ is conceptually equivalent to:
--
-- > foldr f z [] = z
-- > foldr f z [x] = f x z
-- > foldr f z xs = foldr f (foldr f z (tail xs)) [head xs]
--
-- @foldl@ is conceptually equivalent to:
--
-- > foldl f z [] = z
-- > foldl f z [x] = f z x
-- > foldl f z xs = foldl f (foldl f z (init xs)) [last xs]
--
-- Left and right folds are duals of each other.
--
-- @
-- foldr f z xs = foldl (flip f) z (reverse xs)
-- foldl f z xs = foldr (flip f) z (reverse xs)
-- @
--
-- More generally:
--
-- @
-- foldr f z xs = foldl g id xs z where g k x = k . f x
-- foldl f z xs = foldr g id xs z where g x k = k . flip f x
-- @
--

-- As a general rule, foldr cannot have state and foldl cannot have control.

-- NOTE: Folds are inherently serial as each step needs to use the result of
-- the previous step. However, it is possible to fold parts of the stream in
-- parallel and then combine the results using a monoid.

    -- ** Mapping
    -- | In imperative terms a map operation can be considered as a loop over
    -- the stream that transforms the stream into another stream by performing
    -- an operation on each element of the stream.
    --
    -- 'map' is the least powerful transformation operation with strictest
    -- guarantees.  A map, (1) is a stateless loop which means that no state is
    -- allowed to be carried from one iteration to another, therefore,
    -- operations on different elements are guaranteed to not affect each
    -- other, (2) is a strictly one-to-one transformation of stream elements
    -- which means it guarantees that no elements can be added or removed from
    -- the stream, it can merely transform them.

    , sequence
    , mapM
    , mapM_

    -- ** Scanning
    --
    -- | A scan is more powerful than map. While a 'map' is a stateless loop, a
    -- @scan@ is a stateful loop which means that a state can be shared across
    -- all the loop iterations, therefore, future iterations can be impacted by
    -- the state changes made by the past iterations. A scan yields the state
    -- of the loop after each iteration. Like a map, a @postscan@ or @prescan@
    -- does not add or remove elements in the stream, it just transforms them.
    -- However, a @scan@ adds one extra element to the stream.
    --
    -- A left associative scan, also known as a prefix sum, can be thought of
    -- as a stream transformation consisting of left folds of all prefixes of a
    -- stream.  Another way of thinking about it is that it streams all the
    -- intermediate values of the accumulator while applying a left fold on the
    -- input stream.  A right associative scan, on the other hand, can be
    -- thought of as a stream consisting of right folds of all the suffixes of
    -- a stream.
    --
    -- The following equations hold for lists:
    --
    -- > scanl f z xs == map (foldl f z) $ inits xs
    -- > scanr f z xs == map (foldr f z) $ tails xs
    --
    -- @
    -- > scanl (+) 0 [1,2,3,4]
    -- 0                 = 0
    -- 0 + 1             = 1
    -- 0 + 1 + 2         = 3
    -- 0 + 1 + 2 + 3     = 6
    -- 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
    --
    -- > scanr (+) 0 [1,2,3,4]
    -- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 = 10
    --     2 + 3 + 4 + 0 = 9
    --         3 + 4 + 0 = 7
    --             4 + 0 = 4
    --                 0 = 0
    -- @
    --
    -- Left and right scans are duals:
    --
    -- > scanr f z xs ==  reverse $ scanl (flip f) z (reverse xs)
    -- > scanl f z xs ==  reverse $ scanr (flip f) z (reverse xs)
    --
    -- A scan is a stateful map i.e. a combination of map and fold:
    --
    -- > map f xs =           tail $ scanl (\_ x -> f x) z xs
    -- > map f xs = reverse $ head $ scanr (\_ x -> f x) z xs
