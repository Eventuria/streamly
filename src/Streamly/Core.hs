-- | An SVar or a Stream Var is a conduit to the output from multiple streams
-- running concurrently and asynchronously. An SVar can be thought of as an
-- asynchronous IO handle. We can write any number of streams to an SVar in a
-- non-blocking manner and then read them back at any time at any pace.  The
-- SVar would run the streams asynchronously and accumulate results. An SVar
-- may not really execute the stream completely and accumulate all the results.
-- However, it ensures that the reader can read the results at whatever paces
-- it wants to read. The SVar monitors and adapts to the consumer's pace.
--
-- An SVar is a mini scheduler, it has an associated runqueue that holds the
-- stream tasks to be picked and run by a pool of worker threads. It has an
-- associated output queue where the output stream elements are placed by the
-- worker threads. A doorBell is used by the worker threads to intimate the
-- consumer thread about availability of new results in the output queue. More
-- workers are added to the SVar by 'fromStreamVar' on demand if the output
-- produced is not keeping pace with the consumer. On bounded SVars, workers
-- block on the output queue to provide throttling of the producer  when the
-- consumer is not pulling fast enough.  The number of workers may even get
-- reduced depending on the consuming pace.
--
-- New work is enqueued either at the time of creation of the SVar or as a
-- result of executing the parallel combinators i.e. '<|' and '<|>' when the
-- already enqueued computations get evaluated. See 'joinStreamVarAsync'.

--
-- To explain the mechanism imagine that the current task at the head of the
-- stream has a "token" to yield to the output. The ownership of the token is
-- determined by the current sequence number maintained in outputHeap. Sequence
-- number is assigned when a task is queued. When a thread dequeues a task it
-- picks up the sequence number as well and when the output is ready it uses
-- the sequence number to queue the output to the outputQueue.
--
-- The thread with current sequence number sends the output directly to the
-- outputQueue. Other threads push the output to the outputHeap. When the task
-- being queued on the heap is a stream of many elements we yield the first
-- element on the heap and an MVar to wakeup for more elements. When such a
-- task gets the "token" for outputQueue it can directly keep yielding all the
-- elements to the outputQueue without checking for the "token".
--
-- Note that no two outputs in the heap can have the same sequence numbers and
-- therefore we do not need a stable heap. We have also separated the buffer
-- for the current task (outputQueue) and the pending tasks (outputHeap) so
-- that the pending tasks cannot interfere with the current task. Note that for
-- a single task just the outputQueue is enough and for the case of many
-- threads just a heap is good enough. However we balance between these two
-- cases, so that both are efficient.
--
-- For bigger streams it may make sense to have separate buffers for each
-- stream. However, for singleton streams this may become inefficient. However,
-- if we do not have separate buffers, then the streams that come later in
-- sequence may hog the buffer, hindering the streams that are ahead. For this
-- reason we have a single element buffer limitation for the streams being
-- executed in advance.
--
-- This scheme works pretty efficiently with only 50% more overhead compared to
-- the Async streams where we do not have any kind of sequencing of the
-- outputs. It is especially devised so that we are most efficient when we have
-- short tasks and need just a single thread. Also when a thread yields many
-- items it can hold lockfree access to the outputQueue and do it efficiently.
--
-- XXX Maybe we can start the ahead threads at a lower cpu and IO priority so
-- that they do not hog the resources and hinder the progress of the threads in
-- front of them.

-- Running streams concurrently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Concurrency rate control.
--
-- Our objective is to create more threads on demand if the consumer is running
-- faster than us. As soon as we encounter a concurrent composition we create a
-- push pull pair of threads. We use an SVar for communication between the
-- consumer, pulling from the SVar and the producer who is pushing to the SVar.
-- The producer creates more threads if the SVar drains and becomes empty, that
-- is the consumer is running faster.
--
-- XXX Note 1: This mechanism can be problematic if the initial production
-- latency is high, we may end up creating too many threads. So we need some
-- way to monitor and use the latency as well. Having a limit on the dispatches
-- (programmer controlled) may also help.
--
-- TBD Note 2: We may want to run computations at the lower level of the
-- composition tree serially even when they are composed using a parallel
-- combinator. We can use 'serial' in place of 'async' and 'wSerial' in
-- place of 'wAsync'. If we find that an SVar immediately above a computation
-- gets drained empty we can switch to parallelizing the computation.  For that
-- we can use a state flag to fork the rest of the computation at any point of
-- time inside the Monad bind operation if the consumer is running at a faster
-- speed.
--
-- TBD Note 3: the binary operation ('parallel') composition allows us to
-- dispatch a chunkSize of only 1.  If we have to dispatch in arbitrary
-- chunksizes we will need to compose the parallel actions using a data
-- constructor (A Free container) instead so that we can divide it in chunks of
-- arbitrary size before dispatching. If the stream is composed of
-- hierarchically composed grains of different sizes then we can always switch
-- to a desired granularity depending on the consumer speed.
--
-- TBD Note 4: for pure work (when we are not in the IO monad) we can divide it
-- into just the number of CPUs.

-- | Join two computations on the currently running 'SVar' queue for concurrent
-- execution.  When we are using parallel composition, an SVar is passed around
-- as a state variable. We try to schedule a new parallel computation on the
-- SVar passed to us. The first time, when no SVar exists, a new SVar is
-- created.  Subsequently, 'joinStreamVarAsync' may get called when a computation
-- already scheduled on the SVar is further evaluated. For example, when (a
-- `parallel` b) is evaluated it calls a 'joinStreamVarAsync' to put 'a' and 'b' on
-- the current scheduler queue.
--
-- The 'SVarStyle' required by the current composition context is passed as one
-- of the parameters.  If the scheduling and composition style of the new
-- computation being scheduled is different than the style of the current SVar,
-- then we create a new SVar and schedule it on that.  The newly created SVar
-- joins as one of the computations on the current SVar queue.
--
-- Cases when we need to switch to a new SVar:
--
-- * (x `parallel` y) `parallel` (t `parallel` u) -- all of them get scheduled on the same SVar
-- * (x `parallel` y) `parallel` (t `async` u) -- @t@ and @u@ get scheduled on a new child SVar
--   because of the scheduling policy change.
-- * if we 'adapt' a stream of type 'async' to a stream of type
--   'Parallel', we create a new SVar at the transitioning bind.
-- * When the stream is switching from disjunctive composition to conjunctive
--   composition and vice-versa we create a new SVar to isolate the scheduling
--   of the two.
